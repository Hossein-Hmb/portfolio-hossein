## Learning ML from Scratch

As a way of learning, I decided to start from the beginning. That is starting with a perceptron and then slowly
moving to neurons, neural nets, etc.

I think that this project will help me a lot in understanding the fundamentals and all the different aspects of ML.
Such as:

- **Activation Functions**
- Different types of Neural Networks: **ANNs, RNNs and CNNs**
- Different mathematical models and the math behind them: **Linear models**, **Regression models**, etc.

And most importantly, the different application and usecases that **Artificial Intelligence** can have.
