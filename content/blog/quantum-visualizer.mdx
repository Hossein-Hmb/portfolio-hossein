## Why I Chose This Project

I have been interested in quantum computing for a while, and I really wanted to work on a project to learn more and gain
more experience in this field. As such I suggested a few projects to my professor
and he chose this one. He had already been working on a research projects with other researchers, and they
were looking for a way to visualize quantum states. More preciesely, they wanted to visualize the Wigner funcions in 2D and 4D (so 1 mode and 2 modes).

## What I Learned

Prior to this project, I didn't have much experience with quantum computing, I had only read books on quantum physics or quantum computers. So it was
took on this project without knowing much. During the first few weeks, I researched key concepts and theories such as
_Heisenberg's uncertainty principle_, _Wigner function and their Gaussian form_ and the _Wasserstein distance_.
With the help of my co-supervisor, I was able to understand these concepts. Though I still have a long way to go before
I can say I fully understand quantum computing, I feel like I have a good grasp of the basics now.

## Challenges

Besides the initial learning curve, visualzing higher-dimensional data was a challenge. Allthough the highest dimension that
I had to visualize was 4D, I had to find a way to represent this data in a way that is easy to understand. Addiotionally,
the user experience was also a challenge that we worked on iteratively. We opted for an interactive web application where the
user could select different functions, visualize them and change their parameters.

## Tools that I Used

For this project, the main tool was Python. I used Streamlit to build the web application, and I used NumPy and SciPy to
perform the calculations. I also used Plotly to create the 3D plots to visualize the Wigner functions in 2 modes. And I built a simple HTML landing page
to explain how the platform works and what it offers. The landing page is hosted using Vercel, and the we application is hosted
with Heroku.
