## Why This Project?

Quantum computing has always fascinated me, but I've never had the chance to dive deep into it. This project is my opportunity to learn quantum computing fundamentals while applying machine learning—combining two cutting-edge fields that I'm passionate about.

The goal is ambitious but focused: build an ML algorithm that can optimize simple quantum circuits, all within a 2-week sprint. This timeline forces me to be efficient and focused, learning only what's necessary to get the project working.

## Learning Objectives

To build this optimizer, I need to understand:

### 1. **Qubits: The Building Blocks**

- What is a qubit and how it differs from classical bits
- Superposition and entanglement
- Quantum state representation

### 2. **Quantum Gates**

- Basic single-qubit gates (Pauli-X, Y, Z, Hadamard, Phase)
- Multi-qubit gates (CNOT, Toffoli)
- Gate operations and their matrix representations

### 3. **Quantum Algorithms**

- How quantum algorithms work
- Common algorithms (Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover's, etc.)
- Circuit optimization principles

### 4. **Building Quantum Circuits**

- Circuit composition and structure
- How to represent circuits programmatically
- Measuring and executing circuits

### 5. **Tools & Frameworks**

- **Qiskit**: IBM's quantum computing framework
- **PennyLane**: Quantum machine learning library
- **Python**: The language of choice
- **IBM Quantum Courses**: Structured learning resources

## The Plan

### Week 1: Foundations

- Days 1-2: Learn quantum computing basics (qubits, gates, circuits)
- Days 3-4: Get comfortable with Qiskit and PennyLane
- Days 5-7: Build a simple quantum circuit and understand optimization metrics

### Week 2: Implementation

- Days 8-10: Design and implement the ML optimization algorithm
- Days 11-12: Test and refine the optimizer
- Days 13-14: Document results and write up findings

## Tools I'll Use

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **Qiskit**: For quantum circuit construction and simulation
- **PennyLane**: For quantum machine learning capabilities
- **NumPy/SciPy**: Mathematical operations
- **scikit-learn or PyTorch**: ML framework for the optimizer
- **IBM Quantum Courses**: Learning resources
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For experimentation and documentation

## What I'm Building

The goal is to create an ML model that:

1. Takes a quantum circuit as input
2. Analyzes its structure and gate sequence
3. Suggests optimizations (gate reduction, gate reordering, etc.)
4. Learns from optimization patterns to improve over time

The optimizer should reduce circuit depth, minimize gate count, or optimize for specific hardware constraints.

## Challenges I Expect

- **Steep Learning Curve**: Quantum computing concepts are fundamentally different from classical computing
- **Limited Time**: 2 weeks is tight for learning and building
- **Tool Selection**: Choosing between Qiskit and PennyLane, or using both
- **Optimization Metrics**: Defining what "optimized" means for a quantum circuit
- **Simulation Limitations**: Working with simulators rather than real quantum hardware
