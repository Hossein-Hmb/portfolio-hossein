## Creating a 2D Pixel Art Game in Unity

I love video games, and I have always been fascinated by how they are made—the art, the code, and
the stories that bring them to life. For a long time, I wanted to try making my own game, but the
process seemed overwhelming. Now that I have graduated, I have decided to give it a go and learn the
fundamentals of making a game.

Today, there are several tools or frameworks to make a video game. Python has some libraries/frameworks to make a game,
you can use Unity, Godot, and if you want to go to the next level, you can use Unreal Engine.

As I was interested in making a 2D game, I decided to use Unity, which supports 3D games as well. Also, I wanted to learn C#.

## What I Have Done So Far

My first "game" was a simple 2D map with a few tiles that I set up, and a small character that could move around.
This introduced me to the Unity Editor, character movement, camera movement and custom programming.

- **Learning the Unity Interface:** I familiarized myself with the Unity Editor, understanding how scenes, game objects, and components work together.
- **Importing Pixel Art Assets:** I created and imported simple pixel art sprites, experimenting with character and environment designs.
- **Basic Character Movement:** Using C#, I implemented basic movement controls for the main character.
- **Tilemap and Level Design:** I explored Unity’s Tilemap system to design simple levels, making it easier to build and modify the game environment.
- **Simple Interactions:** I added basic interactions, such as collecting items and triggering simple events.

## Why I Chose to Make a Game About Rostam

My next step is to make a game based on the Shahnameh, the epic poem of the Persian mythology. More specifically, the Seven Hurdles
of Rostam, legendary hero of the Persian mythology.

This project will be more complex, as I will need to create a story, characters, and a game world. It will also include combat
mechanics, world interactions, and a lot of other things.
